# Hugo Modular Static Site Project

Welcome to the repository for the Hugo Modular Static Site Project. This project is designed to build a high-performance, scalable, and maintainable website using Hugo. The architecture is split into four distinct repositories—each handling a different aspect of the site—to enable modular development and independent version control.

## Project Aspirations

This project is part of a broader vision to create a modern, modular Hugo site. The site is structured into the following repositories:

- **Hugo Configuration:**  
  Contains site-wide configuration files and deployment scripts.

- **Hugo Theme:**  
  Houses custom themes, layouts, partials, and shortcodes.

- **CSS Assets:**  
  Manages styling resources, including CSS and SCSS files.

- **Markdown Content:**  
  Contains all the site’s content in Markdown format, such as blog posts and pages.

This structure enables efficient collaboration, reuse of components, and easier maintenance across the project.

  - Establish the basic Hugo site structure across these repositories.

- **Theme Development:**
  - Develop a custom Hugo theme with responsive design.
  - Create and refine reusable templates, partials, and shortcodes.

- **CSS and Asset Management:**

  - Integrate SCSS preprocessing using Hugo Pipes (if applicable).

- **Content Creation:**
  - Populate the Markdown content repository with initial pages and blog posts.
  - Develop a content strategy for ongoing updates.

- **CI/CD and Deployment:**
  - Set up continuous integration workflows to trigger site builds upon commits.
  - Automate the deployment process to an AWS S3 bucket.
